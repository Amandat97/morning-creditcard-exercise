## The Challenge

You're starting your own credit card business. You need to come up with a new way to validate credit cards with a simple function calledÂ `validateCreditCard`Â that returnsÂ `true`Â orÂ `false`.

Here are the rules for a valid number:

1. Number must be 16 digits; all of them must be numbers.
2. The final digit must be even.
3. The sum of all the digits must be greater than 16.

## Bonus challenge ðŸ”¥

Add functionality so that you must have at least two different digits represented (all of the digits cannot be the same)

## Examples

- The following credit card numbers are valid:
  - `9999777788880000`
  - `6666666666661666`
- The following credit card numbers are invalid:
  - `a92332119c011112`Â *invalid characters*
  - `4444444444444444`Â *only one type of number*
  - `1111111111111110`Â *sum less than 16*
  - `6666666666666661`Â *odd final number*
